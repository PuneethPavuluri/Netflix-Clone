# Netflix-Clone(https://puneethpavuluri.github.io/Netflix-Clone/)
This Netflix clone is exactly cloned just for the front-end part. This project demonstrates the use of HTML video
tag/properties such as autoplay, loop, mute, etc., image tags, use of SVGs, etc. A lot of CSS properties are also
used for better responsiveness (responsive for all screen sizes) and exact look. Google fonts are used to import
Roboto font-style.
